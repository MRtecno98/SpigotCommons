# Spigot Commons

Spigot Commons helps you coding boring and redundant stuff using the Spigot API.
I'm currently rewriting this project from the ground up! The old version is still available on the `legacy` branch though

# Developing
To compile this project you only need Git and Maven, the procedure is pretty standard.

```
git clone https://github.com/MRtecno98/SpigotCommons.git
cd SpigotCommons
mvn clean package
```
